Building ATL and MFC

To build either ATL or MFC open a command prompt and run vcvars32.bat from <path to vc7>\bin
Change directory to <path to vc7>\atlmfc\src

atlmfc.mak can be used to rebuild all the ATL and MFC library and DLL files.
Following is the command line you can specify with NMAKE from

nmake /f atlmfc.mak [ALL | ATL | MFC] [CLEAN= ] [LIBNAME= ]

	Targets
		ALL - builds both ATL and MFC. This is the default target. LIBNAME has to be specified.
		ATL - builds only ATL.
		MFC - builds only MFC. LIBNAME has to be specified.
		
	CLEAN=1 cleans the files generated by the specified targets
	
	LIBNAME="name of the MFCdll being built" - specifying MFC71 builds the prebuilt DLLs
