// f1rpo (from AdvCiv): At least in Visual Studio 2010, loop macros aren't parsed properly by the code editor unless this hint file is present. Placing the hint file in the project directory is, unfortunately, not working for me. Even with the hint file, statement completion (Ctrl+Space) ignores the variables declared through the first macro argument.

#define FOR_EACH_ENUM(EnumNamePrefix)
#define FOR_EACH_ENUM2(EnumNamePrefix, eVar)
